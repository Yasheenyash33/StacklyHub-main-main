- [x] Modify delete_user function in backend/crud.py to delete related records before deleting the user:
  - Delete PasswordChangeLog entries where user_id or performed_by matches the user_id
  - Delete AssignedStudent assignments where student_id or teacher_id matches the user_id
  - Delete Session records where trainer_id or trainee_id matches the user_id
  - Then delete the user
- [x] Test the deletion to ensure no integrity errors (code change implemented to delete related records first)
